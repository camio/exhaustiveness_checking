# `exhaustiveness_checking`

**PURPOSE:** Provide exhaustivness checking algorithms for C++ Pattern Matching

## Description

This repository contains data structures and algorithms that implement
algorithms for exhaustiveness checking for [Pattern
Matching](http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2020/p1371r2.pdf)
in C++. The code here is not intended to be complete and merely prototypes the
essential aspects of the implementation.

## TODO

- Create a data structure that represents filtered-out, non-contributing patterns.
- Write a function that populates that.
- Create the exhaustiveness checking function.
- Put this work on github.
